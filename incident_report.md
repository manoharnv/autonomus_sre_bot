- Summary: Critical: Database Initialization Failures in python-service-1
- Type: Incident
- Priority: Highest
- URL: https://manoharnv.atlassian.net/browse/SUP-57

Full Incident Description (ADF Format):

**Incident Overview**
Multiple database initialization failures detected in python-service-1 across multiple Kubernetes pods. The issue is causing service degradation and cascading errors in todo operations.

**Error Details**

| Error Type           | Error Message                              | Code Location                  | Timestamps                     | Impact                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Database Initialization | Failed to initialize database          | /app/app.py, <module>, Line 609 | 12:55 - 20:53 (14 occurrences) | Service startup failures   |
| Database Lock        | Database is locked                       | /app/app.py, get_todos, Line 370 | 19:56:05                      | Todo operations blocked    |
| Todo Fetching       | Error fetching todos: list index out of range | /app/app.py, get_todos, Line 373 | 19:56:03-19:56:11 (4 occurrences) | Data inconsistency |

**Affected Services**
- python-service-1 (primary)
- Services consuming python-service-1 APIs

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Incorrect database credentials or configuration
- Network connectivity issues between pods and database
- Database resource constraints (CPU/memory)

**Recommendations**
- Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Validate database credentials and connection strings
- Increase database connection pool size
- Add proper bounds checking for list operations in todo service

**Priority Justification**
This incident is classified as 'Highest' priority due to:
- High frequency of errors (17 in 24 hours)
- Multiple pods affected across the cluster
- Service degradation impacting core functionality
- Potential data inconsistency issues
